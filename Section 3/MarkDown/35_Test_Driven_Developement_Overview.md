# 35. Test Driven Development (TDD) Overview


### What happens in Traditional Developement 
We Design our application first -> Then we write the code for our application -> Then we write tests for our application 

### What happens in Test Driven Developement 
**KEY** -> Start with the **failing test first**
1. First, we start by writing a failing test -> 
2. If so the test is broken and it fails, then we write code to make the test pass -> 
3. Then we refactor our code and then we improve our design(we do some fine tweaking and so forth) -> (Again this cycle starts from 1)  
[This is a continuous cycle and it goes on, we repeat the process for next test]

### BENEFITS 
1. Clear task list of things to test and develop
2. Tests will help you identify edge cases 
3. Develop code in small increments
4. Passing tests increases confidence in code 
5. Gives freedom to refactor.. tests are your safety net... did i break anything?


Project name - **Fizz Buzz**
**Description** - Coding Problem used in technical interviews
**Problem**
Write a program to print the first 100FizzBuzz Numbers. Start at 1 and end at 100 
    1. If number divisible by 3 - print **Fizz**
    2. If number divisible by 5 - print **Buzz**
    3. If number divisible by 3 and 5 - print **FizzBuzz**
    4. If number not divisible by 3 or 5 - print **The Number**

### Sample Outputs 
1 - 1    
2 - 2   
3 - Fizz    
4 - 4     
5 - Buzz   
6 - Fizz   
7 - 7
