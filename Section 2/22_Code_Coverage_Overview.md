# 22. Unit Testing Code Coverage with IntelliJ - Overview

1. Code Coverage measures how many methods/lines are called by your tests 
2. Coverage is represented as a percentage: 50% coverage etc...
3. In general, the higher the coverage the better
    1. However, 100% is not always attainable 
    2. On most teams, 70% - 80% is acceptable 
4. Code Coverage is only a metric and can be easily tricked with bad tests 
5. Use the metric as simple one data point in your software process
